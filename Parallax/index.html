        <p>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets <i>Mercury,
          Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune </i>, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and
          millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids.</p>
        <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes
          87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets</p>
        <p>Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. While scientists continue to hunt for clues of life beyond
          Earth, our home planet remains the only place in the universe where we've ever identified life.</p>
        <p>upiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the
          first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.

          Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as
          massive as all the other planets combined.</p>
